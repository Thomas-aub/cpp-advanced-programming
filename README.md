# Advanced C++ Programming (M1 Informatique - Lyon 1)

## Course Overview
This repository contains the practical work (LABs) from the Advanced C++ Programming course (M1if23) at Universit√© Lyon 1 during the 2023-2024 academic year.

## Key C++ Concepts Explored
- Template metaprogramming
- Polymorphism
- Move semantics
- Generic programming
- Memory management
- STL usage


## Topics Covered

### LAB1: Class Anatomy and Memory Management
- In-depth exploration of C++ constructors and destructors
- Understanding object creation and memory allocation
- Comparison between C++ and Java object creation mechanisms
- Implementation of a `Pixel` and `Image` class
- Comparative analysis of memory management in C++ and Java

Key Concepts:
- Constructor and destructor behavior
- Static vs. dynamic memory allocation
- Compiler optimizations
- Object lifecycle management

### LAB2: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
- RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) capsules
- Move constructors and move assignment operators
- Inheritance and class specialization
- Custom String class implementation from scratch
- Memory management without STL containers

Key Concepts:
- Deep dive into memory management
- Custom string manipulation
- Move semantics
- Inheritance and constructor behaviors

### LAB3: Object-Oriented Programming Techniques
- Function object class creation
- Memory-efficient image representation

### LAB4: Expression Hierarchy and Arithmetic Expressions
- Abstract base class design
- Polymorphic expression evaluation
- Clone mechanism implementation
- Binary expression handling

### LAB5: C++ Templates and Polymorphism
- Generic function templates
- Swap and min functions
- String comparison specializations
- Polymorphic expression optimization

### LAB6: Standard Template Library (STL)
- Container usage (deque, set, list)
- STL algorithms
- Custom generic container implementation
- Iterator design

### LAB7: Advanced C++ Techniques
- STL container, iterator, and algorithm integration
- Move semantics
- Template metaprogramming
- Pixel and image template implementation

## Compilation
Each LAB directory likely contains its own compilation instructions. Typically:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o program source_file.cpp
```
